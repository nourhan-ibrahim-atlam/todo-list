## 📖 About The Project

**مهامي** (meaning *"My Tasks"* in Arabic) is a responsive, RTL-supported task management web application developed as part of a **React.js training course**. The project was built to apply and solidify core React concepts learned throughout the course, including component architecture, state management with the Context API, reducers, and modular UI design.

The app allows users to organize their daily tasks efficiently — adding new ones, marking them as complete, editing details, and removing them — all within a clean, Arabic-first interface.

## 🧠 Key React Concepts Applied

This project was specifically designed to practice and demonstrate the following React skills learned during the course:

- **Component Decomposition** — Breaking the UI into small, reusable pieces
- **Props & State** — Passing data down and managing local component state
- **Context API** — Sharing state across the component tree without prop drilling
- **useReducer** — Managing complex state logic in a centralized reducer function
- **Conditional Rendering** — Showing different UI based on task status and filters
- **Event Handling** — Managing user interactions across multiple components
- **Controlled Components** — Form inputs tied to React state

---

## 📈 SEO Optimizations

The project includes production-ready SEO enhancements:

- ✅ Semantic HTML with proper `lang="ar"` and `dir="rtl"` attributes
- ✅ Descriptive `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags in Arabic
- ✅ **Open Graph** meta tags for rich social media previews
- ✅ **Twitter Card** meta tags
- ✅ **JSON-LD structured data** for Google rich results
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` for search engine crawling
- ✅ `robots.txt` with `.map` file protection
